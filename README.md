represents the result of locations of various points on graph with resize and rescale using 
scaler method. In addition to this it can be very helpful to visualize the distance between each point 
to every point in a graph

the result is shown in table format where source location and destination 
with optimize path distance is calculated for every possible path. It shows optimize path distance 
for every route present in the graph using algorithmic stage
